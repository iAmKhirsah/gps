    "After the economic chaos of 2020, this year offers you opportunities to rebuild and grow professionally, but it won't be easy for you or anyone else. The hard work and effort you put in last year will start to pay off, but you'll need to keep up some of the momentum. An eclipse in your sign brings a burst of unexpected news, further encouraging your personal growth that the new year brings.",

    "You are ruled by the sun, so you were actually born to be in the spotlight. Social distancing was hard for everyone, but it's possible it affected your sign the most, leaving you to get creative. As the world starts to heal in 2021, you'll feel like a lion trapped in a cage bursting to get out. When you do, you'll want to say yes to every date and every opportunity, but beware of short-term thinking. Your 2021 mission is to practice patience and be discerning.",

    "You care about your community, and the events of 2020 gave you plenty of chances to keep busy by lending a hand. Whether you became your family's point person and organizer of Zoom holidays or dove into activism, you likely stayed so busy tending to others that you forgot about your own needs. Now, 2021 shines a spotlight on you, precious water bearer, and it's time to step into it",
